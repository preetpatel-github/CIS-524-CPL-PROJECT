# Explanation/Comparison

->Python:
# Concept:1--> Python is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are inferred at runtime. There's no need to declare variable types explicitly, allowing flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors.
# Concept:2--> Python uses eager evaluation, where expressions are evaluated as soon as they're encountered. This can lead to inefficiencies when dealing with large data structures or complex computations.
# Conpect:3--> Python supports multiple paradigms, including imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming. It allows for mutable data structures and encourages imperative-style coding.

->Haskell:
--Concept:1--> Haskell is statically typed, requiring explicit type declarations for variables and functions. The type system in Haskell is strong and inferred at compile time, ensuring type safety and preventing many runtime errors.
--Concept:2--> Haskell employs lazy evaluation by default, where expressions are evaluated only when their results are required. This can lead to more efficient memory usage and the ability to work with infinite data structures.
--Concept:3--> Haskell is primarily a functional programming language. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions without side effects, and a declarative style of programming. This approach promotes clearer, more concise code and better reasoning about programs.
